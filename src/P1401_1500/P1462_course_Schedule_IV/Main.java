//Explanation of the Solution
//Matrix Initialization:
//Create a boolean[][] isPrerequisite to represent the prerequisites between courses.
//If isPrerequisite[a][b] is true, it means course a is a prerequisite for course b.
//Direct Prerequisites:
//Populate the matrix based on the direct prerequisites given in the input.
//Floyd-Warshall Algorithm:
//Iterate through all course pairs (i, j) and check if there's an intermediate course k such that i -> k -> j. If so,
// mark isPrerequisite[i][j] as true.
//Answer Queries:
//For each query (u, v), simply return the value of isPrerequisite[u][v] from the matrix.
//Complexity Analysis
//Time Complexity:
//Floyd-Warshall algorithm runs in O(n^3), where n is the number of courses.
//Answering each query takes O(1), so for q queries, the total query time is O(q).
//Overall: O(n^3+q).
//Space Complexity:
//The isPrerequisite matrix requires O(n^2) space.
//This solution is efficient for nâ‰¤100, as stated in the constraints.


//There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an
// array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course ai first if
// you want to take course bi.
//For example, the pair [0, 1] indicates that you have to take course 0 before you can take course 1.
//Prerequisites can also be indirect. If course a is a prerequisite of course b, and course b is a prerequisite of
// course c, then course a is a prerequisite of course c.
//You are also given an array queries where queries[j] = [uj, vj]. For the jth query, you should answer whether
// course uj is a prerequisite of course vj or not.
//Return a boolean array answer, where answer[j] is the answer to the jth query.
//
//Example 1:
//Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]], queries = [[0,1],[1,0]]
//Output: [false,true]
//Explanation: The pair [1, 0] indicates that you have to take course 1 before you can take course 0.
//Course 0 is not a prerequisite of course 1, but the opposite is true.

//Example 2:
//Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [], queries = [[1,0],[0,1]]
//Output: [false,false]
//Explanation: There are no prerequisites, and each course is independent.

//Example 3:
//Input: numCourses = 3, prerequisites = [[1,2],[1,0],[2,0]], queries = [[1,0],[1,2]]
//Output: [true,true]
//
//Constraints:
//2 <= numCourses <= 100
//0 <= prerequisites.length <= (numCourses * (numCourses - 1) / 2)
//prerequisites[i].length == 2
//0 <= ai, bi <= numCourses - 1
//ai != bi
//All the pairs [ai, bi] are unique.
//The prerequisites graph has no cycles.
//1 <= queries.length <= 104
//0 <= ui, vi <= numCourses - 1
//ui != vi
