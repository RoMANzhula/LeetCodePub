//Complexity:
// time - O(n^3)
// space - O(1)


//You are given a 2D array points of size n x 2 representing integer coordinates of some points on a
// 2D-plane, where points[i] = [xi, yi].
//We define the right direction as positive x-axis (increasing x-coordinate) and the left direction as
// negative x-axis (decreasing x-coordinate). Similarly, we define the up direction as positive
// y-axis (increasing y-coordinate) and the down direction as negative y-axis (decreasing y-coordinate)
//You have to place n people, including Alice and Bob, at these points such that there is exactly one person at
// every point. Alice wants to be alone with Bob, so Alice will build a rectangular fence with Alice's position as
// the upper left corner and Bob's position as the lower right corner of the fence (Note that the fence might not
// enclose any area, i.e. it can be a line). If any person other than Alice and Bob is either inside the fence or
// on the fence, Alice will be sad.
//Return the number of pairs of points where you can place Alice and Bob, such that Alice does not become sad on
// building the fence.
//Note that Alice can only build a fence with Alice's position as the upper left corner, and Bob's position as the
// lower right corner. For example, Alice cannot build either of the fences in the picture below with four
// corners (1, 1), (1, 3), (3, 1), and (3, 3), because:
//With Alice at (3, 3) and Bob at (1, 1), Alice's position is not the upper left corner and Bob's position is not
// the lower right corner of the fence.
//With Alice at (1, 3) and Bob at (1, 1), Bob's position is not the lower right corner of the fence.

//Example 1:
//Input: points = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]]
//Output: 0
//Explanation: There is no way to place Alice and Bob such that Alice can build a fence with Alice's position as
// the upper left corner and Bob's position as the lower right corner. Hence we return 0.

//Example 2:
//Input: points = [[6,2],[4,4],[2,6]]
//Output: 2
//Explanation: There are two ways to place Alice and Bob such that Alice will not be sad:
//- Place Alice at (4, 4) and Bob at (6, 2).
//- Place Alice at (2, 6) and Bob at (4, 4).
//You cannot place Alice at (2, 6) and Bob at (6, 2) because the person at (4, 4) will be inside the fence.

//Example 3:
//Input: points = [[3,1],[1,3],[1,1]]
//Output: 2
//Explanation: There are two ways to place Alice and Bob such that Alice will not be sad:
//- Place Alice at (1, 1) and Bob at (3, 1).
//- Place Alice at (1, 3) and Bob at (1, 1).
//You cannot place Alice at (1, 3) and Bob at (3, 1) because the person at (1, 1) will be on the fence.
//Note that it does not matter if the fence encloses any area, the first and second fences in the image are valid.

//Constraints:
//2 <= n <= 1000
//points[i].length == 2
//-109 <= points[i][0], points[i][1] <= 109
//All points[i] are distinct.
