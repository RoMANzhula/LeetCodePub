//You are given a string s and an integer t, representing the number of transformations to perform. In one
// transformation, every character in s is replaced according to the following rules:
//If the character is 'z', replace it with the string "ab".
//Otherwise, replace it with the next character in the alphabet. For example, 'a' is replaced with 'b', 'b' is
// replaced with 'c', and so on.
//Return the length of the resulting string after exactly t transformations.
//Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

//Example 1:
//Input: s = "abcyy", t = 2
//Output: 7
//Explanation:
//First Transformation (t = 1):
//'a' becomes 'b'
//'b' becomes 'c'
//'c' becomes 'd'
//'y' becomes 'z'
//'y' becomes 'z'
//String after the first transformation: "bcdzz"
//Second Transformation (t = 2):
//'b' becomes 'c'
//'c' becomes 'd'
//'d' becomes 'e'
//'z' becomes "ab"
//'z' becomes "ab"
//String after the second transformation: "cdeabab"
//Final Length of the string: The string is "cdeabab", which has 7 characters.

//Example 2:
//Input: s = "azbk", t = 1
//Output: 5
//Explanation:
//First Transformation (t = 1):
//'a' becomes 'b'
//'z' becomes "ab"
//'b' becomes 'c'
//'k' becomes 'l'
//String after the first transformation: "babcl"
//Final Length of the string: The string is "babcl", which has 5 characters.

//Constraints:
//1 <= s.length <= 105
//s consists only of lowercase English letters.
//1 <= t <= 105
