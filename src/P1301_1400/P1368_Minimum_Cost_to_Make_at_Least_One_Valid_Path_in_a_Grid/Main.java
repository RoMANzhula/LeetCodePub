//Explanation:
//Grid Representation and Directions:
//-Each cell in the grid has four possible directions (right, left, down, up), encoded as {1, 2, 3, 4}.
//-The DIRECTIONS array maps these directions to coordinate changes.
//Deque for 0-1 BFS:
//The deque is used to prioritize zero-cost moves (offerFirst) over moves with a cost of 1 (offerLast).
//Cost Array:
//Tracks the minimum cost to reach each cell. Initialize it with Integer.MAX_VALUE.
//Iterative BFS:
//-For each cell, evaluate all four possible directions. If the move follows the grid's direction, it's zero
// cost; otherwise, it incurs a cost of 1.
//-Update the cost array and add the new position to the deque accordingly.
//Output:
//After processing all possible paths, the cost to reach the bottom-right cell (cost[m-1][n-1]) is returned.
//Complexity:
//This approach ensures an efficient traversal of the grid with a time complexity of O(mÃ—n), making it suitable
// for the given constraints.


//Given an m x n grid. Each cell of the grid has a sign pointing to the next cell you should visit if you are
// currently in this cell. The sign of grid[i][j] can be:
//1 which means go to the cell to the right. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i][j + 1])
//2 which means go to the cell to the left. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i][j - 1])
//3 which means go to the lower cell. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i + 1][j])
//4 which means go to the upper cell. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i - 1][j])
//Notice that there could be some signs on the cells of the grid that point outside the grid.
//You will initially start at the upper left cell (0, 0). A valid path in the grid is a path that starts from the
// upper left cell (0, 0) and ends at the bottom-right cell (m - 1, n - 1) following the signs on the grid. The
// valid path does not have to be the shortest.
//You can modify the sign on a cell with cost = 1. You can modify the sign on a cell one time only.
//Return the minimum cost to make the grid have at least one valid path.
//
//Example 1:
//Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1],[2,2,2,2],[1,1,1,1],[2,2,2,2]]
//Output: 3
//Explanation: You will start at point (0, 0).
//The path to (3, 3) is as follows. (0, 0) --> (0, 1) --> (0, 2) --> (0, 3) change the arrow to down
// with cost = 1 --> (1, 3) --> (1, 2) --> (1, 1) --> (1, 0) change the arrow to down
// with cost = 1 --> (2, 0) --> (2, 1) --> (2, 2) --> (2, 3) change the arrow to down
// with cost = 1 --> (3, 3)
//The total cost = 3.

//Example 2:
//Input: grid = [[1,1,3],[3,2,2],[1,1,4]]
//Output: 0
//Explanation: You can follow the path from (0, 0) to (2, 2).

//Example 3:
//Input: grid = [[1,2],[4,3]]
//Output: 1
//
//Constraints:
//m == grid.length
//n == grid[i].length
//1 <= m, n <= 100
//1 <= grid[i][j] <= 4
