//Explanation:
//Union-Find (DSU)
//We use the parent array to store the parent nodes.
//We use the rank array to balance the union operation.
//The find(x) method performs path compression for quick access to the root of a set.
//The union(x, y) method merges sets. If x and y are already in the same set, it returns false (indicating this is
// the redundant edge).
//Edge Traversal
//If union(edge[0], edge[1]) returns false, it means the edge creates a cycle and is the answer.
//Complexity:
//find(x) ~ O(Î±(n)), union(x, y) ~ O(Î±(n)), where Î±(n) is the inverse Ackermann function (very small, practically O(1)).
//Overall complexity: O(n).
//This code runs efficiently even for n = 1000. ðŸš€


//In this problem, a tree is an undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles.
//You are given a graph that started as a tree with n nodes labeled from 1 to n, with one additional edge added. The
// added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to n, and was not an edge that already existed. The
// graph is represented as an array edges of length n where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an
// edge between nodes ai and bi in the graph.
//Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of n nodes. If there are multiple answers,
// return the answer that occurs last in the input.
//
//Example 1:
//Input: edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
//Output: [2,3]

//Example 2:
//Input: edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,4],[1,5]]
//Output: [1,4]
//
//Constraints:
//n == edges.length
//3 <= n <= 1000
//edges[i].length == 2
//1 <= ai < bi <= edges.length
//ai != bi
//There are no repeated edges.
//The given graph is connected.
