}

//Explanation:
//Base Case: We initialize dp[i][i] = 1 because a single character requires exactly one print.
//Optimization:
//If s[i] == s[j], we reduce the problem size by merging s[i] and s[j], using the previous result dp[i][j-1].
//Instead of checking all splits, we focus on more beneficial splits by leveraging character equality, thus
// reducing unnecessary cycles.
//Result: The result is retrieved from dp[0][n-1], which gives the minimum number of turns required to print
// the entire string.
//Time Complexity
//The optimized approach still has a time complexity of O(n^3) in the worst case but is faster in practice due
// to reduced redundant calculations. This is often the best possible for problems involving 2D DP over a string.
// However, for the typical problem constraints (n â‰¤ 100), this solution will perform efficiently.


//There is a strange printer with the following two special properties:
//The printer can only print a sequence of the same character each time.
//At each turn, the printer can print new characters starting from and ending at any place and will cover the
// original existing characters.
//Given a string s, return the minimum number of turns the printer needed to print it.
//
//Example 1:
//Input: s = "aaabbb"
//Output: 2
//Explanation: Print "aaa" first and then print "bbb".

//Example 2:
//Input: s = "aba"
//Output: 2
//Explanation: Print "aaa" first and then print "b" from the second place of the string, which will
// cover the existing character 'a'.
//
//Constraints:
//1 <= s.length <= 100
//s consists of lowercase English letters.
