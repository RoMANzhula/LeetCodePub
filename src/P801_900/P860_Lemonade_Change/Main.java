//Key Points:
//Early Exit: The function returns false as soon as it detects that correct change can't be provided. This prevents
// further unnecessary iterations through the list of bills.
//Switch-Case Structure: This structure is more readable and might be slightly faster because the JVM
// optimizes switch-case statements efficiently.
//Input Validation: The switch-case structure also includes a default case to handle any unexpected bill values,
// although according to the problem constraints, this shouldnâ€™t happen. This is more for robustness.


//At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs $5. Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you and order one at
// a time (in the order specified by bills). Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with
// either a $5, $10, or $20 bill. You must provide the correct change to each customer so that the net
// transaction is that the customer pays $5.
//Note that you do not have any change in hand at first.
//Given an integer array bills where bills[i] is the bill the ith customer pays, return true if you can provide
// every customer with the correct change, or false otherwise.
//
//Example 1:
//Input: bills = [5,5,5,10,20]
//Output: true
//Explanation:
//From the first 3 customers, we collect three $5 bills in order.
//From the fourth customer, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5.
//From the fifth customer, we give a $10 bill and a $5 bill.
//Since all customers got correct change, we output true.

//Example 2:
//Input: bills = [5,5,10,10,20]
//Output: false
//Explanation:
//From the first two customers in order, we collect two $5 bills.
//For the next two customers in order, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5 bill.
//For the last customer, we can not give the change of $15 back because we only have two $10 bills.
//Since not every customer received the correct change, the answer is false.
//
//Constraints:
//1 <= bills.length <= 105
//bills[i] is either 5, 10, or 20.
