//Explanation of the Code:
//Sorting Items: The items are sorted by price in ascending order, and within the same price, by beauty in
// descending order. This ensures we always have the highest beauty for each price point.
//Precomputing Maximum Beauty: As we iterate through the sorted items, we keep track of the maximum beauty
// seen so far for any given price.
//Sorting Queries: We store the indices of queries, sort them based on query values, and then use a
// two-pointer approach (or binary search) to answer each query efficiently.
//Binary Search for Queries: For each query, we find the maximum beauty of items with prices less than or
// equal to the queryâ€™s price by accessing the priceBeautyList.
//
//Complexity Analysis:
//Time Complexity:
//O(N log N+M log M), where N is the length of items and M is the length of queries. Sorting items and queries takes
//O(N log N) and O(M log M) respectively, and binary search in the precomputed list takes
//O(logN) for each query.
//Space Complexity:
//O(N+M), for storing the priceBeautyList and the result array.


//You are given a 2D integer array items where items[i] = [pricei, beautyi] denotes the price and beauty of
// an item respectively.
//You are also given a 0-indexed integer array queries. For each queries[j], you want to determine the
// maximum beauty of an item whose price is less than or equal to queries[j]. If no such item exists,
// then the answer to this query is 0.
//Return an array answer of the same length as queries where answer[j] is the answer to the jth query.
//
//Example 1:
//Input: items = [[1,2],[3,2],[2,4],[5,6],[3,5]], queries = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
//Output: [2,4,5,5,6,6]
//Explanation:
//- For queries[0]=1, [1,2] is the only item which has price <= 1. Hence, the answer for this query is 2.
//- For queries[1]=2, the items which can be considered are [1,2] and [2,4].
//  The maximum beauty among them is 4.
//- For queries[2]=3 and queries[3]=4, the items which can be considered are [1,2], [3,2], [2,4], and [3,5].
//  The maximum beauty among them is 5.
//- For queries[4]=5 and queries[5]=6, all items can be considered.
//  Hence, the answer for them is the maximum beauty of all items, i.e., 6.

//Example 2:
//Input: items = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,3],[1,4]], queries = [1]
//Output: [4]
//Explanation:
//The price of every item is equal to 1, so we choose the item with the maximum beauty 4.
//Note that multiple items can have the same price and/or beauty.

//Example 3:
//Input: items = [[10,1000]], queries = [5]
//Output: [0]
//Explanation:
//No item has a price less than or equal to 5, so no item can be chosen.
//Hence, the answer to the query is 0.
//
//Constraints:
//1 <= items.length, queries.length <= 105
//items[i].length == 2
//1 <= pricei, beautyi, queries[j] <= 109
